# Python exercises

1. Write a Python program to find those numbers which are both divisible by 7 and 5, between 1500 and 2700 (both included).

2. Write a Python program that prints all the numbers from 0 to 6 except 3 and 6.

3. Write a Python program which iterates the integers from 1 to 50. For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

4. Write a Python program to find numbers between 100 and 400 (both included) where each digit of a number is an even number. The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence.

5. Write a program that asks a user for a number and then tests whether it is prime or not and prints out “The number is prime” or “The number is not prime”.

6. Write a Python function to find the Max of three numbers, then ask the user for three numbers and test it.

7. Write a Python program to guess a number between 1 to 9.
Note : User is prompted to enter a guess. If the user guesses wrong then the prompt appears again until the guess is correct, on successful guess, user will get a "Well guessed!" message, and the program will exit.

8. Write a python function to reverse a string, then ask the users for a string to test it.

9. Write a Python function that accepts a string and calculate the number of upper case letters and lower case letters. 

10. Create a program that calculates cooking times for meat based on the following criteria:
Present the user with a menu where they type 1 for Beef (well done), 2 for Chicken, 3 for Lamb and 4 for Pork and ask them for the weight of the piece of meat in kg
Calculate the cooking time for Beef using this formula 50 minutes per kg plus 20 minutes
Calculate the cooking time for Chicken using this formula 45 minutes per Kg plus 20 minutes
Calculate the cooking time for Lamb using this formula 60 minutes per kg plus 30 minutes
Calculate the cooking time for Pork using this formula 70 minutes per kg plus 35 minutes
Print out “The cooking time for a piece of <meat name> that weighs <weight> is <time> minutes”

11. Make a two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game.

12. Create a program that will play the “cows and bulls” game with the user. The game works like this:
Randomly generate a 4-digit number where each digit is unique. Ask the user to guess a 4-digit number. For every digit that the user guessed correctly in the correct place, they have a “cow”. For every digit the user guessed correctly in the wrong place is a “bull.” Every time the user makes a guess, tell them how many “cows” and “bulls” they have. Once the user guesses the correct number, the game is over. Keep track of the number of guesses the user makes throughout the game and tell the user at the end.

13. Write a Python program to convert temperatures to and from celsius, fahrenheit

14. Write a Python program to check the validity of password input by users. Go to the editor. Hint: import the module re and use re.search to find characters.
Validation :
At least 1 letter between [a-z] and 1 letter between [A-Z].
At least 1 number between [0-9].
At least 1 character from [$#@].
Minimum length 6 characters.
Maximum length 16 characters.

# Python Tasks

This is a repository that contains some basic exercises and projects. These were completed as part of my learning of python whilst I was on my bootcamp

To practice running the scripts, you first need to ensure that you have python installed on your device.

To run any of the scripts, just move into the directory where the files are stored e.g. `cd /home/user/python-tasks/solutions/python-tasks/` then execute the following command `python3 <file-name>.py`

Here are the questions for you to try:
[1. Python tasks](python-tasks.md)
[2. Python-Linux tasks](python-linux-tasks.md)
